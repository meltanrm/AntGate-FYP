# AntGate-FYP

In this repo, you will find the STL files and code used to construct an automated ant size sorter system in the <a href="https://github.com/meltanrm/AntGate-FYP/tree/main/Final%20Product">Final Product</a> folder. The relevant files and code used for prototyping and idea iteration can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/meltanrm/AntGate-FYP/tree/main/Prototypes">Prototypes</a> folder.

<b>Integrating ant detection input from the neural network</b>
<br>You will need <a href="https://github.com/FabianPlum/TheStick">TheStick</a> repo and to follow the instructions written there. Replace TheStick's tracker.py and THE_STICK_YOLO.py files with the modified files found in the <a href="https://github.com/meltanrm/AntGate-FYP/tree/main/OAKD%20Operation">OAKD Operation folder</a>.

You will also need the arduino code in the <a href="https://github.com/meltanrm/AntGate-FYP/tree/main/oakd_to_motor">oakd_to_motor</a> folder.

<b>Recording videos using the OAK-D cameras</b>
<br>Use the <a href="https://github.com/nimirz/FilmAnts">FilmAnts</a> repo to record videos using the OAK-D cameras. Should there be problems in running the script, replacing the files with those in <a href="https://github.com/meltanrm/AntGate-FYP/tree/main/Prototypes/OAKD%20recording%20videos">OAKD recording videos</a>seemed to do the trick for me.
